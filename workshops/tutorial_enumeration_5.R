# What happens when we CAN'T enumerate the whole architecture space?
# Eg. computational limitations, 
# OR
# we're trying to run tests, but we can't do the whole thing!

# Our random samples need to meet 3 criteria:
# 1. be **big enough** overall (eg. n = 10,000)
# 2. be **big enough** within each group (eg. n = 100 per strata)
# 3. be evenly balanced (eg. no traits are disproportionately represented)
# Let's learn how.

# SAMPLING #########################


# Suppose you have a decision, 
# but you can only **sample 2 out of 4 alternatives.**
# You can use sample_n() from dplyr for that.
enumerate_sf(n = c(4)) %>%
  sample_n(size = 2)

# sample_n(tbl = ., size = 2, replace = FALSE)




# The most common case where you'll run into this is...
# You can easily enumerate the whole architectural space,
# BUT
# you can't run optimization on the whole space,
# so you need to run optimization on a smaller sample.

# Here's what you'd do.


# If you can, always try to enumerate the whole architectural space first.

# eg.

# Get your full architectural space
arch = expand_grid(
  enumerate_sf(n = c(2,4,3), .did = 1),
  enumerate_ds(n = 3, k = 2, .did = 4),
  enumerate_permutation(n = 8, k = 4, .did = 5)
)

arch %>% glimpse()

## BY ROW #####################

# You can take a random sample directly,
# but it may cause issues - always important to check representativeness.
mini = arch %>%
  sample_n(size = 10000)

## BY DECISION #########################

# Or, we could sample after each consecutive decision.
# This has trade-offs too.
# Eg. enumerate your matrix, then after each stage, sample, then continue.

part1 = expand_grid(
  enumerate_sf(n = 2, .did = 1),
  enumerate_sf(n = 4, .did = 2) 
) %>%
  # For each alternative in d1, 
  # sample 2 alternatives from d2
  group_by(d1) %>%
  sample_n(size = 2)  %>%
  ungroup()


part2 = part1 %>%
  # Get the full grid of those options and
  # ALL options from d3
  expand_grid(enumerate_sf(n = 3, .did = 3)) %>%
  # for each alternative in d1 and d2,
  # sample 2 alternatives from d3
  group_by(d1,d2) %>%
  sample_n(size = 2) %>%
  ungroup()

part3 = part2 %>%
  # Expand out for d4...
  expand_grid(enumerate_ds(n = 3, k = 2, .did = 4)) %>%
  # For each set of d1,d2, and d3,
  # sample 5 possible outcomes from d4
  group_by(d1,d2,d3) %>%
  sample_n(size = 5)

part4 = part3 %>%
  # Expand out for d5...
  expand_grid(enumerate_permutation(n = 8, k = 4, .did = 5)) %>%
  # For each set of d1,d2,d3,and d4_1,d4_2,d4_3,
  # sample 25 possible outcomes from d5
  # You can write it easily using 'across(start:end)'
  #group_by(d1,d2,d3,d4_1,d4_2,d4_3) %>%
  group_by(across(d1:d4_3)) %>%
  sample_n(size = 25) %>%
  ungroup()
  

# Not too terrible to code, right?

# What are some downfalls to this method?
# Can you think of a better way to enumerate?
# What would you need to do?





## BY STRATA ###################
# For each strata (a set of unique d1-d2-d3-d4_1-d4_2-d4_3 values)
# sample 25 rows (akin to grabbing 25 paths)
arch %>%
  group_by(across(d1:d4_3)) %>%
  sample_n(size = 25)






## BY PATH #####################

          s5_1 == TRUE &  s5_2 == TRUE & s5_3 == TRUE & s5_4 == TRUE)
