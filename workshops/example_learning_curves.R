# We might also want to estimate the learning curve involved in certain decisions. 
# For example, suppose we have Decision X, 
# the choice to make and use tool A instead of tool B. 
# Decision X is costly to our time at first, 
# but over time, we are expected to get better at making tool A.
# Suppose Tool A has an S = 80% learning curve.

# Learning Curve Formula: Y = aX^b
# suppose a 80% learning curve 
s <- 0.80

# means each time quantity doubles, you gain 20% in efficiency.
gains <- 1 - s

# Calculate the slope of the learning curve
b <- log(s) / log(2.00)

# If it takes 30 hours to make 
# tool A at the beginning...
a <- 30

# What happens if we make tool A many times?
x <- c(1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200)

# Our slope suggests that the average time to make Tool A becomes...
y <- a * x^b
y

# Let's plot that learning curve!
